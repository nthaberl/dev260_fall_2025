# Assignment 6: Game Matchmaking System - Implementation Notes

**Name:** Natascha

## Multi-Queue Pattern Understanding

**How the multi-queue pattern works for game matchmaking:**
[Explain your understanding of how the three different queues (Casual, Ranked, QuickPlay) work together and why each has different matching strategies]

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
[Describe the most difficult part of the assignment - was it the skill-based matching, queue management, or match processing?]
implementing ranked matching was biggest challenge


**How you solved it:**
[Explain your solution approach and what helped you figure it out]
decided to store it into an array

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand about queues, matchmaking algorithms, or game mode differences?]

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
[Highlight the best aspect of your code - maybe your skill matching logic, queue status display, or error handling]

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
[Identify areas for potential improvement - perhaps better algorithms, more features, or cleaner code structure]

## Testing Approach

**How you tested your implementation:**
[Describe your overall testing strategy - how did you verify skill-based matching worked correctly?]

**Test scenarios you used:**
[List specific scenarios you tested, like players with different skill levels, empty queues, etc.]

**Issues you discovered during testing:**
[Any bugs or problems you found and fixed during development]

## Game Mode Understanding

**Casual Mode matching strategy:**
[Explain how you implemented FIFO matching for Casual mode]

**Ranked Mode matching strategy:**
[Explain how you implemented skill-based matching (±2 levels) for Ranked mode]

**QuickPlay Mode matching strategy:**
[Explain your approach to balancing speed vs. skill matching in QuickPlay mode]

## Real-World Applications

**How this relates to actual game matchmaking:**
[Describe how your implementation connects to real games like League of Legends, Overwatch, etc.]

**What you learned about game industry patterns:**
[What insights did you gain about how online games handle player matching?]

## Stretch Features

[If you implemented any extra credit features like team formation or advanced analytics, describe them here. If not, write "None implemented"]

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [X hours]

**Breakdown:**

- Understanding the assignment and queue concepts: [X hours]
- Implementing the 6 core methods: [X hours]
- Testing different game modes and scenarios: [X hours]
- Debugging and fixing issues: [X hours]
- Writing these notes: [X hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why - algorithm design, debugging, testing, etc.]

## Key Learning Outcomes

**Queue concepts learned:**
[What did you learn about managing multiple queues and different processing strategies?]

**Algorithm design insights:**
[What did you learn about designing matching algorithms and handling different requirements?]

**Software engineering practices:**
[What did you learn about error handling, user interfaces, and code organization?]
