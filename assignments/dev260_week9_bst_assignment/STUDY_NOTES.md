# Assignment 9: BST File System Navigator - Implementation Notes

**Name:** [Natascha]

## Binary Search Tree Pattern Understanding

**How BST operations work for file system navigation:**
*[Explain your understanding of how O(log n) searches, automatic sorting through in-order traversal, and hierarchical file organization work together for efficient file management]*

Answer:

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
*[Describe the most difficult part of the assignment - was it recursive tree algorithms, custom file/directory comparison logic, or complex BST deletion?]*

Answer: 

**How you solved it:**
*[Explain your solution approach and what helped you figure it out - research, debugging, testing strategies, etc.]*

Answer:

**Most confusing concept:**
*[What was hardest to understand about BST operations, recursive thinking, or file system hierarchies?]*

Answer: I always struggled with recursive thinking in the past but using 

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
*[Highlight the best aspect of your code - maybe your recursive algorithms, custom comparison logic, or efficient tree traversal]*

Answer:

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
*[Identify areas for potential improvement - perhaps better error handling, more efficient algorithms, or additional features]*

Answer:

## Real-World Applications

**How this relates to actual file systems:**
*[Describe how your implementation connects to tools like Windows File Explorer, macOS Finder, database indexing, etc.]*

Answer:

**What you learned about tree algorithms:**
*[What insights did you gain about recursive thinking, tree traversal, and hierarchical data organization?]*

Answer: 

## Stretch Features

*[If you implemented any extra credit features like file pattern matching or directory size analysis, describe them here. If not, write "None implemented"]*

Answer: N/A
